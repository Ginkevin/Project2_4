Alice in Chains>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>># Alice in Chains are a rock band which formed in 1987 in Seattle, Washington, United States. Drawing equally from the heavy riffing of metal and the gloomy strains of grunge, the band developed a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding metallic riffs with subtly textured acoustic numbers. They were hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands. While this dichotomy helped the group soar to multi-platinum status with their second album, 1992&amp;#8217;s Dirt, it also divided them.

Bush (band)>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>># Bush may refer to at least 2 artists: 1. A British post-grunge band 2. A Canadian rock band 1. Bush is an English alternative rock band formed in 1992. The group chose the name &quot;Bush&quot; because they used to live in Shepherd&amp;#8217;s Bush, London. Their first album, Sixteen Stone (1994), was a huge commercial success. Almost overnight, Bush went from playing small pubs in London to headlining arenas in the US, the result of extensive promotion on MTV and non-stop touring. Critics labeled them as an inferior derivative of bands such as Nirvana and Pixies, and this criticism followed them throughout their career as a band. In particular, Rossdale&amp;#8217;s throaty singing voice and random, stream of consciousness-style lyrics were dismissed by some as an imitation of Nirvana&amp;#8217;s lead singer, Kurt Cobain.

They started out playing parties and outdoor events, which quickly led to bookings at Chicago clubs when youngest member Joe was just 16.

Refusing to employ a lead guitarist, they played loud synth infused dance punk on the drum and bass combination alone. They added the 1979 suffix to the name following a legal dispute with New York City dance-punk label Death From Above (known as DFA Records since the September 11, 2001 attacks). &quot;Death from above&quot; was written on a helicopter in the movie Apocalypse Now, which was copyrighted in 1979. However, Grainger says this is simply a coincidence; 1979 was chosen as it was, amongst other reasons, &quot;the year I was born.&quot; Discover more music, concerts, videos, and $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$#100303

Driver Friendly>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>># Three years after the release of their successful debut full length album Chase the White Whale, Driver Friendly knew something had to change. The music industry was shifting, their lives were headed in separate directions, and the future of the band was in question. The band was at a crossroads: call it quits after nine years of making music together or do something drastic. The answer was a retreat to a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains, a place where they could create without distractions or limitations, a place where they promised they wouldnâ¬"t leave until they had a new album ready to be recorded.

Drowners>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>># Hometown: New York. Band lineup: Matt Hitt (vocals, guitar), Jack Ridley III (guitar), Erik Lee Snyder (bass), and Joe Brodie (drums). We can&amp;#8217;t tell yet if Drowners are a typical New York band or a typical London one. They&amp;#8217;re said by some to be part of the ongoing Britpop renaissance (Blur and Pulp reforming, new bands like Blackeye forming), but really they have more in common with the early-noughties CBGBs revival. Their music has as much in common with the late-70s UK new wave era as it does the US one. Their songs recall punk at its most pop â¬ we keep thinking of Eddie and the Hot Rods&amp;#8217; Do Anything You Wanna Do whenever we hear Drowners&amp;#8217; Long Hair and You&amp;#8217;ve Got It All Wrong.

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros>>>>>>>>>>>>>># Birthed by Mouth in the year two-thousand and five, young Edward Sharpe had to wait nearly two years before he was to grow his arms and legs and fingers and toes.

Snatches of &amp;#8217;60s guitar riffs sat next to &amp;#8217;80s guitar noise, and &amp;#8217;70s punk rubbed shoulders with &amp;#8217;70s schlock metal; all of it proved his knack for treating the worst pop music as serious rock.

And Love Spit Love have powerfully returned with a second album and their first for Maverick. (Edit: 2/4/2010: Love Spit Love is sadly also long gone - 13 years gone, in fact. Apparently the long-term intentions were crushed by the reality of hardly anyone knowing about them, Richard&amp;#8217;s pre-existing claim to fame notwithstanding.

A life-long lover of folk music, Collins always thought he lacked the necessary credentials to find a place in the folk scene; being raised in a faceless new town with no sense of tradition, he felt totally divorced from the bucolic sounds of the 1960s folk-revival.

The band was formed in 1991 (then later split in 2005 reforming in 2008), by keyboardist / multi-instrumentalist Geoff Barrow, Adrian Utley and singer Beth Gibbons. Barrow had previously worked with Massive Attack and Tricky whilst tape operator at Coach House Studios in Clifton. He was often referred to as &quot;that bloke from Portishead&quot; and so decided to name his new musical endeavour after his hometown.

Altogether, they sound very much like a slightly more melodic version of The Jesus and Mary Chain.

Spaceman) and Peter Kember (a.k.a. Sonic Boom). Their first album, Sound of Confusion (1986), was not successful commercially, but it attracted a loyal fan base. Its follow-up, 1987&amp;#8217;s Perfect Prescription, is a concept album mirroring the highs and lows of a drug trip. It expanded the group&amp;#8217;s core of fans and is generally considered their masterpiece. Playing With Fire[/url] (1989) expanded on the psychedelic and drone themes of the earlier albums; its second single, &quot;Revolution&quot; reached #1 on the UK indie charts. But soon after, a combination of personnel changes, drug problems and intra-band tension (especially between Kember and Pierce) began to break the band apart.

Tim met ex-drummer Ben Davis during a cigarette break at school.

Wax on Radio brings a fresh, well-developed sound to rock music at a time when the genre seems to have reached a creative plateau. Familiar, successful formulas like emo, nu metal, hardcore are being played out all over the charts but there is an undeniable restlessness among fans and a sense that rock is overdue for a blast of fresh air.

However, itâ¬"s a brief blast of promise that should more than whet the appetite for whatâ¬"s to come from the five-piece and serves as a ringing statement of intent. A 12-track debut album &amp;#8216;All Our Kings Are Dead&amp;#8217; was released on the 21st of July 2010, and was well-received by both critics and fans alike.
